<img src="./home.png" alt="screenshot of application">
Decoupled application that uses a React frontend and Node Express server with MySQL database, Sequelize ORM, and Passport for secure authentication. 


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. <!-- See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### Prerequisites
What things you need installed before running this application.

* [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)
* [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running


1) Inside the server folder update the config.json file which is located in the config folder.
```
 "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "account_demo",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }

```

2)
```
# Open MySQL shell and run: 
> CREATE DATABASE "$dbname";
# The database name should reflect what is in the config file.
# no need to create any tables, this application use sequelize which will sync the models that are in the server directory

```

3)
```
# Open a new shell and navigate to the server directory
$ npm i
# this will install all dependencies for the node portion of this application
# once the installs have completed
$ node server.js
# the Node application is set to run on PORT 8000 
# * if you update the PORT make sure to update the proxy in the client package.json as well

```

4)
```
# Open a new shell navigate into the client directory
$ yarn install
# this will install all dependencies for the react portion of this application
# once the installs have completed
$ yarn start 
# the React application by default will run on PORT 3000

```
